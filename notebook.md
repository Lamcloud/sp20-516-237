## Week 01/27/20 - 02/01/20
 
* :o2: Weekly Assignments:
  * Propose Chapter
  * Read Architecture and Python Chapters
  * Write paragraph on why venv is needed (below):
    * We need to use venv every time we log in and attempt to run python programs on our laptops to protect our default environment.  If we do pip installs and other configuration changes to environment variables and paths in our default environment we could destabilize or corrupt our default environment.  The great thing about a venv is that if anything gets corrupted in it, you just have to delete it and recreate it and problem is solved.  If that would happen in your default environment then it we be much more messy to try and clean up and might even require a reinstall of python, pycharm or worse.
