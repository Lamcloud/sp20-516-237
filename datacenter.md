The Facebook Prineville Data Center is located in the town of Prineville, OR.  It opened on January 20, 2010.  It has been expanded multiple times over the years and is currently in the middle of it's latest expansion which will bring it to essentially 5 data centers [@Rogoway2018-sp20-516-237] in one that brings the total campus size to about 3.2 million square feet [@Facebook2020-sp20-516-237].  The thing that stands out to me about this data center is it's energy efficiency.  Per Facebook this is one of the most energy efficient facilities of it's kind in the world [@Facebook2020-sp20-516-237].  This latest expansion will allow them to become 100% solar powered [@Facebook2020-sp20-516-237].  Per Facebook their PUE is between 1.06 and 1.08 [@Facebook2020-sp20-516-237] which is pretty outstanding given that the average PUE in 2019 for major data centers around the world was 1.67 [@datacenter2019-sp20-516-237].

Wind energy is a renewable source of energy that has been leveraged as such for longer than most types of renewable energy.  As early as 2000BC humans were using wind energy as an energy source [@Rinkesh-sp20-516-237].  Early use cases for wind energy were things like windmills for crushing grain or pumping water but today the technology has evolved significantly.  You can find wind turbines today that have blades 184 feet long on average and around the height of the Statue of Liberty coming in at about 290 feet tall [@Hartman2019-sp20-516-237].  With the advancements in the technology it has the ability to generate more energy than ever.  Per Hartman [@Hartman2019-sp20-516-237], "The United States’ wind power capacity was 96,433 megawatts at the end of 2018, making it the largest renewable generation capacity in the United States. That’s enough electricity to offset the consumption of 25 million average American homes".

Given the higher energy output and lower cost of wind energy it has started to be used more to power data centers.  One example of this is Microsoft's Cheyenne, Wyoming facility [@Patrizio2016-sp20-516-237].  The data center is run completely using wind energy and it's total power consumption is around 200 MW per year [@Baxtel-sp20-516-237].  This is a part of Microsoft's goal to become more and more renewable energy dependent and brings the company's total wind capacity to 500 MW across the United States [@Patrizio2016-sp20-516-237]

Iceland is a great example of a country committed to renewable energy.  It has developed it's in-country sources of renewable energy to the point where 85% of their primary energy needs are met from these.  Iceland has been fortunate on this quest with it's geography and geology that give it access to abundant sources of both hydro and geothermal sources of energy [@inspiredbyiceland-sp20-516-237].  The use of renewable energy has not just benefited the environment but has been transformational for the Icelandic society.  They went from being a poor, coal reliant society to one currently experiencing a very high standard of living due to the economic boost of producing almost all of their energy in-country and the private investment uptic from environment conscious companies looking to limit the carbon foot print of energy intensive facilities such as data centers [@inspiredbyiceland-sp20-516-237].  In addition, most Icelandic homes (90%) are now heated by geothermal water that is piped in from nearby boreholes making affordable, clean water available to almost everyone [@inspiredbyiceland-sp20-516-237].

The impact of a major data center outage can be felt not just by the companies hosting their services inside the datacenter but by the broader extended internet community.  To the operator alone the costs can be very high.  Per Cloudscene [@Cloudscene2019-sp20-516-237] outage downtime costs for operators in 2018 was $260,000 on average.  The total cost including downstream impact is difficult to assess.  An example of such an outage was the Facebook outage in March of 2019.  It was a 14-hour outage that didn't only impact it's users but also it's advertisers around the world.  Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Workplace went down together with the main Facebook platform.  Per Cloudscene [@Cloudscene2019-sp20-516-237], Facebook is still investigating the total impact but they speculate that it's very large given that Facebook's daily ad revenue stands at around $250 million making any downtime very expensive for Facebook directly but also expensive for their customers who's lost revenue due to advertising down time is much harder to quantify.
