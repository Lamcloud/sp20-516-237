The Facebook Prineville Data Center is located in the town of Prineville, OR.  It opened on January 20, 2010.  It has been expanded multiple times over the years and is currently in the middle of it's latest expansion which will bring it to essentially 5 data centers [@rogoway_2018] in one that brings the total campus size to about 3.2 million square feet [@facebook].  The thing that stands out to me about this data center is it's energy efficiency.  Per Facebook this is one of the most energy efficient facilities of it's kind in the world [@facebook].  This latest expansion will allow them to become 100% solar powered [@facebook].  Per Facebook their PUE is between 1.06 and 1.08 [@facebook] which is pretty outstanding given that the average PUE in 2019 for major data centers around the world was 1.67 [@datacenter.com].
