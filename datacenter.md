The Facebook Prineville Data Center is located in the town of Prineville, OR.  It opened on January 20, 2010.  It has been expanded multiple times over the years and is currently in the middle of it's latest expansion which will bring it to essentially 5 data centers [@rogoway_2018] in one that brings the total campus size to about 3.2 million square feet [@facebook].  The thing that stands out to me about this data center is it's energy efficiency.  Per Facebook this is one of the most energy efficient facilities of it's kind in the world [@facebook].  This latest expansion will allow them to become 100% solar powered [@facebook].  Per Facebook their PUE is between 1.06 and 1.08 [@facebook] which is pretty outstanding given that the average PUE in 2019 for major data centers around the world was 1.67 [@datacenter.com].

Wind energy is a renewable source of energy that has been leveraged as such for longer than most types of renewable energy.  As early as 2000BC humans were using wind energy as an energy source [@rinkesh_2017].  Early use cases for wind energy were things like windmills for crushing grain or pumping water but today the technology has evolved significantly.  You can find wind turbines today that have blades 184 feet long on average and around the height of the Statue of Liberty coming in at about 290 feet tall [@hartman_2019].  With the advancements in the technology it has the ability to generate more energy than ever.  Per Hartman [@hartman_2019], "The United States’ wind power capacity was 96,433 megawatts at the end of 2018, making it the largest renewable generation capacity in the United States. That’s enough electricity to offset the consumption of 25 million average American homes".

Given the higher energy output and lower cost of wind energy it has started to be used more to power data centers.  One example of this is Microsoft's Cheyenne, Wyoming facility [@patrizio_2016].
